"Hikari Hates the Default Schema" Bug
========================================

Given a default schema in the JDBC URL, new connections using that JDBC URL should be connected to the default schema. However, we have a symptom in an application
that suggests this is not the case for HikariCP connections. This PoC is determining if Hikari is, in fact, ignoring the default schema on the JDBC URL.

Set-Up
=========

Have MySQL running locally on its default port (`3306`). As `root`,  execute the following commands:

```sql

CREATE DATABASE hikaribug;
CREATE USER 'hikaripoc'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'hikari good or bad';
GRANT ALL ON hikaribug.* TO 'hikaripoc'@'localhost';

```

Run
======

`./gradlew run`

If it passes successfully, the bug isn't with Hikari. If you see a stack trace, you _may_ have just found a bug.  (Or you borked your configuration.)

TL;DR
======

* `Robert` â€” Can't reproduce the reported bug as of October 21st, 2015 (commit `16dcfdd`).
